TO start active directory here is what you need first

DNS
Static IP address
Domain controller name = mylabdc.local
NetBIOS domain name = lab

ping an IP on the VM and make sure it is not taken, no response means it is available

Set the static IP for the server with the IP that is available, the way you know how.
your gateway will show with ipconfig

DNS is the same as default gateway and test with google.com


# Active Directory install

server manager
Add roles and feautures, next, next
select Active directory services, select DNS server as well, add features, next, next, next, install

close

on server manager dashboard click notifcations and promote server to domain controller.
Add new forest
Root domain name = mylabdc.local, next
set password: same as admin, next, next
NetBIOS domain name = LAB, next, install when prereq are done
Reboot


# make sure everything is working

Look for Active directory programs like you know how
After opening AD you'll see your forest. 
You'll see domain controller and see your current server.

Also search for DNS and find your DNS server application
from cmd run nslookup lab windows and see the name resolve to the IP
