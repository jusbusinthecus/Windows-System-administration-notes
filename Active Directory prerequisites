TO start active directory here is what you need first

DNS
Static IP address
Domain controller name = mylabdc.local
NetBIOS domain name = lab

ping an IP on the VM and make sure it is not taken, no response means it is available

Set the static IP for the server with the IP that is available, the way you know how.
your gateway will show with ipconfig

DNS is the same as default gateway and test with google.com
